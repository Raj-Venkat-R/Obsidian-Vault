**Pattern:** Greedy / Array Traversal  
**Status:** Solved ✅

## 🔹 Problem Summary
You are given an array where each element represents the stock price on a given day.  
You can complete **as many transactions as you want** (buy one stock and sell it later), but you must sell the stock before buying again.  
The goal is to calculate the **maximum profit** possible.

---

## 🔹 My First Thought (Initial Approach)
At first, it felt like I needed to explicitly decide on buy and sell days.  
But since multiple transactions are allowed, I realized I only need to take profit whenever the price increases.

---

## 🔹 Key Observation
- Multiple transactions are allowed
- Profit can be accumulated from **every increase**
- It is not necessary to track exact buy and sell days
- Small profits added together give the maximum profit

---

## 🔹 Final Approach (Step-by-Step in English)
1. Traverse the price array from the second day onward
2. Compare the current day’s price with the previous day’s price
3. If today’s price is higher than yesterday’s:
   - Add the difference to the total profit
4. If today’s price is lower or equal:
   - Do nothing
5. Continue until the end of the array

---

## 🔹 Example Walkthrough
Input:
[7,1,5,3,6,4]

Process:
- 1 → 5 : profit = 4
- 3 → 6 : profit = 3

Final Output:
7

## 🔹 Java Code (Final)
> ⚠️ Code added after fully understanding the logic.

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        int profit = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < prices.length; i++) {
            if (prices[i] > prices[i - 1]) {
                profit += prices[i] - prices[i - 1];
            }
        }
        return profit;
    }
}
```

## 🔹 Time & Space Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(n)  
  The price array is traversed once, comparing adjacent days.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)  
  Only a single variable is used to store the total profit.

---

## 🔹 Patterns Learned
- Greedy approach
- Accumulating profit from every upward price movement
- Adjacent element comparison
- Multiple transactions without explicit buy/sell tracking

---

## 🔹 Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Treating this like LeetCode 121 (single transaction)
- Trying to track exact buy and sell days
- Using nested loops or peak–valley logic unnecessarily
- Skipping small profits instead of adding them
