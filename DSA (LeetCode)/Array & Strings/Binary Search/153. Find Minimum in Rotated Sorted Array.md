title: "LeetCode 153 – Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array"
difficulty: Medium
pattern: Binary Search
status: Understood
---
## 🔹 Problem Summary
Given a rotated sorted array with **no duplicates**, find the **minimum element** in O(log n) time.

The array was originally sorted in ascending order and then rotated.

---

## 🔹 My First Thought (Initial Approach)
Traverse the array and track the minimum.

❌ Time complexity is O(n), which does not satisfy the problem requirement.

---

## 🔹 Key Observation
In a rotated sorted array:
- One half is always sorted
- The **minimum lies in the unsorted half**
- Comparing `nums[mid]` with `nums[high]` tells where the minimum is

---

## 🔹 Final Approach (Step-by-Step in English)

1. Use two pointers `low` and `high`.
2. While `low < high`:
   - Calculate `mid`.
   - If `nums[mid] > nums[high]`, the minimum is in the **right half**.
   - Otherwise, the minimum is in the **left half including mid**.
3. When loop ends, `low` points to the minimum element.

---

## 🔹 Example Walkthrough

Input:
nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]

Process:
- mid = 3 → nums[3] > nums[6] → move low to mid + 1
- Continue binary search
- Stop when low == high

Final Output:
0

## 🔹 Java Code (Final)
> ⚠️ Code added after fully understanding the logic.

```java
class Solution {
    public int findMin(int[] nums) {
        int low = 0;
        int high = nums.length - 1;

        while (low < high) {
            int mid = (low + high) / 2;

            if (nums[mid] > nums[high]) {
                // minimum is in the right half
                low = mid + 1;
            } else {
                // minimum is in the left half (including mid)
                high = mid;
            }
        }
        return nums[low];
    }
}
```

## 🔹 Time & Space Complexity

Time Complexity:
- O(log n)

Space Complexity:
- O(1)

---

## 🔹 Patterns Learned

- Binary search works on rotated arrays
- Comparing with `high` helps detect the unsorted part
- Minimum element is the rotation pivot

---

## 🔹 Common Mistakes to Avoid

- Using `low <= high` instead of `low < high`
- Returning `nums[mid]` instead of `nums[low]`
- Comparing `nums[mid]` with `nums[low]`
- Forgetting that `mid` can be the minimum
