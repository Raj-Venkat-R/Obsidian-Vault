title: LeetCode 2460 – Apply Operations to an Array
difficulty: Easy
pattern: Two Pointers / Array Manipulation
status: Solved
---

## 🔹 Problem Summary
Given an integer array `nums`, perform the following operations **from left to right**:

1. If two adjacent elements are equal:
   - Double the first element
   - Set the second element to `0`
2. After processing the entire array, move all `0`s to the **end**
   while maintaining the relative order of non-zero elements.

---

## 🔹 My First Thought (Initial Approach)
Directly simulate the operations as stated in the problem and then rearrange the array.

Brute force shifting after every operation would be messy and inefficient.

---

## 🔹 Key Observation
- The problem naturally splits into **two independent tasks**:
  1. Apply doubling and zeroing
  2. Move all zeros to the end
- Moving zeros is a classic **two-pointer** problem (same as LC 283)

Separating the logic keeps the solution clean and bug-free.

## 🔹 Final Approach (Step-by-Step in English)

### Step 1: Apply Operations
1. Traverse the array from left to right.
2. If `nums[i] == nu
