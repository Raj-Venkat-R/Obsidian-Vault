# What is an Array?

## 🔹 Definition

An **array** is a data structure that stores **multiple elements of the same data type** in a **contiguous block of memory**.

In simple words:
> An array keeps related data **side by side** in memory and lets us access each element using an **index**.

---

## 🔹 Contiguous Memory (MOST IMPORTANT IDEA)

**Contiguous memory** means:
- All elements are stored **next to each other**
- No gaps between elements
- Memory addresses increase sequentially

### Memory Diagram

```
Memory Address →   100   104   108   112   116
Array Elements →  | 10 | 20 | 30 | 40 | 50 |
Index           →   0     1     2     3     4
```

Each element:
- Takes the **same amount of memory**
- Is placed immediately after the previous one

---

## 🔹 Why Contiguous Memory Matters

Because elements are stored side by side, the computer can:
- Calculate the location of any element directly
- Jump to it **without scanning** other elements

Formula (conceptual):
```
element_address = base_address + (index × size_of_element)
```

This is why arrays are **fast**.

---

## 🔹 Indexing

- Each element in an array has an **index**
- Index starts from **0**
- Index is used to access elements

Example:
```
Array → [10, 20, 30, 40]

Index →  0   1   2   3
```

So:
- Index `0` → first element
- Index `length - 1` → last element

---

## 🔹 What Can an Array Store?

An array stores:
- Elements of **only one data type**

Examples:
- Integer array → only integers
- Character array → only characters
- Object array → references of same object type

Why?
- Memory needs to know **exact size** of each element to place them contiguously.

---

## 🔹 Logical View vs Memory View

### Logical View (what programmer sees)
```
[10, 20, 30, 40]
```

### Memory View (what computer sees)
```
| 10 | 20 | 30 | 40 |
```

Same data, different perspectives.

---

## 🔹 Key Characteristics of Arrays

- Fixed memory layout
- Direct access using index
- Same type elements
- Ordered collection
- Zero-based indexing

---

## 🔹 One-Line Intuition (Remember This)

> **Array = fast access because data is stored continuously in memory**

This single idea explains:
- Why arrays are fast
- Why insertions/deletions are costly
- Why arrays are used everywhere in DSA
