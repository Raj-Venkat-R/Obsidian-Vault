# Indexing & Traversal in Arrays

## 🔹 What is Indexing?

**Indexing** is the way we **identify and access** each element in an array.

- Every element is assigned a **number** called an **index**
- Index represents the **position** of the element
- Indexing starts from **0**

### Example

```
Array →  [ 10 , 20 , 30 , 40 , 50 ]
Index →    0    1    2    3    4
```

- First element → index `0`
- Last element → index `length - 1`

---

## 🔹 Why Indexing Starts from 0?

Because array indexing is based on **memory offset**.

If:
- Base address = starting memory
- Index = offset from base

Then:
- Index `0` → base address
- Index `1` → base + size of one element

This makes address calculation simple and fast.

---

## 🔹 Accessing Elements Using Index (Java Syntax)

```java
int[] arr = {10, 20, 30, 40};

int first = arr[0];   // 10
int third = arr[2];   // 30
```

⚠️ If you access:
```java
arr[4];
```
You will get:
```
ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
```

Valid index range:
```
0  →  arr.length - 1
```

---

## 🔹 Updating Elements Using Index

Arrays allow **direct update** using index.

```java
arr[1] = 99;
```

### Diagram

```
Before → | 10 | 20 | 30 | 40 |
After  → | 10 | 99 | 30 | 40 |
```

No shifting required → very fast.

---

## 🔹 What is Traversal?

**Traversal** means:
> Visiting **each element** of the array **one by one**

Traversal is required when:
- Printing elements
- Searching
- Finding max/min
- Calculating sum
- Applying logic to all elements

---

## 🔹 Traversal Using for-loop (Most Important)

```java
for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    System.out.println(arr[i]);
}
```

### How it Works (Diagram)

```
i = 0 → arr[0]
i = 1 → arr[1]
i = 2 → arr[2]
...
```

Stops when:
```
i == arr.length
```

---

## 🔹 Traversal Using Enhanced for-loop

```java
for (int value : arr) {
    System.out.println(value);
}
```

### Key Difference

| Normal for-loop | Enhanced for-loop |
|-----------------|------------------|
| Index available | Index NOT available |
| More control    | Cleaner syntax    |
| Used in LeetCode logic | Mostly for reading |

- Use enhanced loop only when **index is not needed**.

---

## 🔹 Forward vs Reverse Traversal

### Forward Traversal
```
Index: 0 → 1 → 2 → 3
```

### Reverse Traversal
```java
for (int i = arr.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    System.out.println(arr[i]);
}
```

```
Index: 3 → 2 → 1 → 0
```

Reverse traversal is common in:
- Right-to-left logic
- Certain greedy problems

---

## 🔹 Traversal Cost (Intuition)

- Traversing an array of size `n`
- Visits every element once
- Work grows as array grows

This idea will later become:
> **Linear time complexity**

(No formulas yet — just intuition)

---

## 🔹 Common Indexing & Traversal Mistakes

- Using `i <= arr.length` instead of `<`
- Forgetting index starts at `0`
- Accessing `arr[length]`
- Mixing index and value
- Modifying array while traversing incorrectly

---

## 🔹 Core Mental Model

> Index = position  
> Traversal = visiting all positions one by one

Master this and:
- Two pointers becomes easy
- Sliding window becomes natural
- Prefix sum becomes obvious
