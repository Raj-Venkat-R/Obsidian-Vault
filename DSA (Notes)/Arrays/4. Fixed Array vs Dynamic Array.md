# Fixed vs Dynamic Arrays

Arrays can be classified based on **size flexibility**:
- **Fixed Arrays**
- **Dynamic Arrays**

The core difference is **whether the size can change after creation**.

---

## 🔹 Fixed Array

### What is a Fixed Array?

A **fixed array** is an array whose **size is decided at creation time and cannot be changed**.

### Java Example
```java
int[] arr = new int[5];
```

- Physical size = 5
- Logical size ≤ 5
- Cannot grow or shrink

---

## 🔹 Memory View (Fixed Array)

```
| 10 | 20 | 30 | _ | _ |
```

- Memory block is fixed
- Extra slots remain unused
- Programmer must track logical size

---

## 🔹 Characteristics of Fixed Arrays

- Fixed physical size
- Stored in contiguous memory
- Very fast index access
- Manual insertion & deletion
- Risk of overflow or wasted memory

---

## 🔹 Limitations of Fixed Arrays

- Size must be known beforehand
- Cannot handle growing input easily
- Manual resizing is required
- Shifting needed for insert/delete

---

## 🔹 Dynamic Array

### What is a Dynamic Array?

A **dynamic array** is an array that **automatically grows or shrinks** as elements are added or removed.

⚠️ Important:
> Dynamic arrays internally still use **fixed arrays**.

---

## 🔹 Java Dynamic Array: `ArrayList`

In Java, **`ArrayList`** is the most common dynamic array.

```java
ArrayList<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>();
```

You do **not** manage:
- Capacity
- Resizing
- Shifting

Java does it for you.

---

## 🔹 How `ArrayList` Works Internally (Concept)

When the internal array becomes full:
1. A new **larger array** is created
2. All elements are copied
3. Reference points to new array
4. Old array is discarded

```
Old → | 10 | 20 | 30 |
New → | 10 | 20 | 30 | _ | _ | _ |
```

Resizing is costly but happens **rarely**, so average performance is good.

---

## 🔹 Capacity vs Size (Important)

- **Capacity** → internal array length
- **Size** → number of stored elements

`ArrayList` manages both automatically.

---

## 🔹 Important `ArrayList` Functions (MUST KNOW)

### ➤ Adding Elements

```java
list.add(10);          // add at end
list.add(1, 20);       // add at index
```

---

### ➤ Accessing Elements

```java
int x = list.get(0);
```

---

### ➤ Updating Elements

```java
list.set(1, 99);
```

---

### ➤ Removing Elements

```java
list.remove(2);        // remove by index
list.remove(Integer.valueOf(10)); // remove by value
```

⚠️ Removing shifts elements automatically.

---

### ➤ Size Information

```java
int s = list.size();   // logical size
```

---

### ➤ Checking Elements

```java
list.contains(30);
```

---

### ➤ Finding Index

```java
list.indexOf(20);
```

---

### ➤ Clearing the List

```java
list.clear();
```

---

### ➤ Traversing an ArrayList

```java
for (int i = 0; i < list.size(); i++) {
    System.out.println(list.get(i));
}
```

```java
for (int val : list) {
    System.out.println(val);
}
```

## 🔹 Fixed Array vs ArrayList (Quick Comparison)

| Feature | Fixed Array | ArrayList |
|------|------------|-----------|
| Size | Fixed | Dynamic |
| Resizing | Manual | Automatic |
| Access | Fast | Fast |
| Insert/Delete | Costly | Easier |
| Syntax | Simple | Rich API |
| Used in LeetCode | Sometimes | Very common |

---

## 🔹 When to Use What

### Use Fixed Array when:
- Size is known
- Memory is tight
- Low-level control needed

### Use ArrayList when:
- Size is unknown
- Frequent insert/delete
- Cleaner and safer code needed

---

## 🔹 Core Mental Model (LOCK THIS)

> **ArrayList is a dynamic wrapper over a fixed array**

Understanding this explains:
- Performance behavior
- Why resizing is not instant
- Why shifting still exists
