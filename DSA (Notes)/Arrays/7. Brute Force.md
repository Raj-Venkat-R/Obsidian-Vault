# 🧠 Brute Force Thinking with Arrays

Brute force is **not bad**.  
It is the **starting point of all correct solutions**.

---

## 🔹 What is Brute Force?

**Brute force** means:
> Trying **all possible ways** to solve a problem  
> without worrying about optimization initially.

In arrays, this usually means:
- Nested loops
- Checking every element
- Checking every pair or subarray

---

## 🔹 Why Brute Force is IMPORTANT

Many beginners try to jump directly to:
- Two pointers
- Sliding window
- Hashing

This causes:
- Confusion
- Wrong logic
- Memorized solutions ❌

Correct flow:
```
Understand problem → Brute force → Optimize
```

If brute force is wrong, optimization will also be wrong.

## 🔹 How to Think Brute Force (Step-by-Step)

When given an array problem, ask:

1. What is required?
2. Which elements are involved?
3. Do I need:
   - One element?
   - Two elements?
   - A range of elements?
4. Can I check all possibilities?

---

## 🔹 Common Brute Force Patterns in Arrays

### 1. Single Loop (Check Every Element)

Used when:
- Finding max / min
- Counting
- Checking condition

Mental model:
```
for each element → do something
```

---

### 2. Double Loop (Check Every Pair)

Used when:
- Comparing two elements
- Finding pairs
- Checking relationships

Mental model:
```
for each element
    for each other element
```

---

### 3. Triple Loop (Check Every Subarray)

Used when:
- Working with ranges
- Calculating sums of subarrays
- Checking all combinations

Mental model:
```
start index
    end index
        process elements
```

---

## 🔹 Example Thought Process (NO CODE)

Problem idea:
> Find the maximum sum of any subarray

Brute force thinking:
- Fix a starting index
- Fix an ending index
- Compute sum for that range
- Compare with maximum

This approach is:
- Simple
- Correct
- Slow for large input

But correctness comes first.

---

## 🔹 Why Brute Force is Slow (Intuition)

As input grows:
- One loop → grows slowly
- Two loops → grows faster
- Three loops → grows very fast

Brute force works for:
- Small input
- Understanding logic
- Building confidence

---

## 🔹 How Optimization Comes from Brute Force

Optimization means:
> Removing **repeated work**

Common repeated work in arrays:
- Recalculating sums
- Rechecking same elements
- Scanning same range again

This leads to:
- Prefix sum
- Sliding window
- Hashing

All optimizations are **brute force + smart idea**.

---

## 🔹 Brute Force vs Optimized Thinking

| Aspect | Brute Force | Optimized |
|-----|------------|-----------|
| Simplicity | Very high | Medium |
| Speed | Slow | Fast |
| Correctness | Easy to ensure | Needs care |
| Learning value | Highest | Depends on base |

---

## 🔹 When to STOP Brute Force

You stop brute force when:
- Time limit is exceeded
- Input size is large
- You see repeated computation

But never skip brute force **thinking**.

---

## 🔹 Common Beginner Mistakes

- Skipping brute force entirely
- Trying to memorize optimized patterns
- Writing complex logic too early
- Debugging optimized code without understanding base logic

---

## 🔹 Core Mental Model (LOCK THIS)

> **Brute force gives correctness**  
> **Optimization gives efficiency**

Never reverse this order.
