# Array vs List (Java Context)

In Java, **Array** and **List (ArrayList)** are both used to store collections of data,  
but they are designed for **different use cases**.

Understanding this difference helps you:
- Write cleaner code
- Avoid performance issues
- Choose correctly in LeetCode problems

---

## 🔹 Array (Java)

### What is an Array?

An **array** is a **fixed-size**, indexed collection of elements stored in **contiguous memory**.

### Example
```java
int[] arr = new int[5];
```

---

### Key Properties of Array

- Fixed size (cannot grow or shrink)
- Fast index-based access
- Stores primitive types directly
- Minimal memory overhead
- No built-in utility methods

---

## 🔹 List (ArrayList in Java)

### What is a List?

A **List** is a **dynamic collection** that can grow or shrink automatically.

In Java, the most common List implementation is **ArrayList**.

### Example
```java
ArrayList<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>();
```

---

### Key Properties of List

- Dynamic size
- Internally uses an array
- Automatic resizing
- Rich set of methods
- Stores objects (uses wrapper classes)

---

## 🔹 Core Differences (Conceptual)

| Aspect | Array | ArrayList |
|-----|------|-----------|
| Size | Fixed | Dynamic |
| Memory | Contiguous | Contiguous (internally) |
| Resizing | ❌ Manual | ✅ Automatic |
| Access | Fast | Fast |
| Insert/Delete | Costly | Easier |
| Built-in methods | ❌ | ✅ |
| Syntax | Simple | Rich API |

---

## 🔹 Primitive Types vs Objects (IMPORTANT)

### Array
```java
int[] arr = new int[5];
```
- Stores **primitive values directly**

### ArrayList
```java
ArrayList<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>();
```
- Stores **objects**, not primitives
- Uses **wrapper classes** (`Integer`, `Double`, etc.)

This causes:
- Slight memory overhead
- Autoboxing / unboxing

---

## 🔹 Accessing Elements

### Array
```java
arr[2];
```

### ArrayList
```java
list.get(2);
```

Both are fast, but array syntax is simpler.

---

## 🔹 Insertion Comparison

### Array
- Must check capacity
- Manual shifting
- Manual size tracking

### ArrayList
- `add()` handles everything
- Shifting done internally
- Size managed automatically

---

## 🔹 Removal Comparison

### Array
- Manual shifting
- Logical size update required

### ArrayList
```java
list.remove(index);
```
- Shifting handled automatically

---

## 🔹 Performance Insight (LeetCode View)

- Arrays are slightly **faster**
- ArrayList is **safer and easier**
- Difference is usually negligible unless constraints are tight

---

## 🔹 When to Use Array

Use **Array** when:
- Size is fixed or known
- Performance is critical
- You need primitive storage
- Memory overhead must be minimal

---

## 🔹 When to Use ArrayList

Use **ArrayList** when:
- Size is unknown
- Frequent insert/delete
- Cleaner and safer code
- You want built-in utilities

---

## 🔹 Common Beginner Confusions

- ❌ Thinking ArrayList is not an array  
- ❌ Thinking ArrayList resizes magically without cost  
- ❌ Forgetting wrapper classes  
- ❌ Using ArrayList when fixed array is enough

---

## 🔹 Core Mental Model (LOCK THIS)

> **ArrayList is a dynamic wrapper over a fixed array**

If you understand this sentence,  
you understand **both** data structures.
